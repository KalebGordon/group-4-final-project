## Description of the dataset
The dataset we chose for our final project contains emission totals per country from The Food and Agriculture Organization. The dataset covers dates January 1, 2000 through December 31, 2020.  The following statistics are tracked in this dataset: area (country), item (source of emission), element (type of emission), unit (emissions = kilotons), and year (total emissions for each year). This dataset was derived from The Food and Agriculture Organization’s Emissions Total Data and The Food and Agriculture Organization’s Definitions and Standards. 

## Question we plan to answer with the project
•	Within a given year, we would like to predict CO2 levels based on emissions.
