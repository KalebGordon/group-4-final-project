# group-4-final-project
Group 4 final project. 

## Description of the dataset
The dataset we chose for our final project contains emission totals per country from The Food and Agriculture Organization. The dataset covers dates January 1, 2000 through December 31, 2020.  The following statistics are tracked in this dataset: area (country), item (source of emission), element (type of emission), unit (emissions = kilotons), and year (total emissions for each year). This dataset was derived from The Food and Agriculture Organization’s Emissions Total Data and The Food and Agriculture Organization’s Definitions and Standards. 

## Questions we plan to answer with the project
•	Within a given year, can we predict the CO2 level based on emissions? 

•	What was the impact of any environmental protection accords on a given year? An example is the Paris Climate Agreement and the emissions impact.
