#### Outline for Presentation/Visualizations:
1) Intro Page - overview of the presentation

2) Snapshot of the tables being used.
    - Total Emissions Table
    - Outdoor Air Pollution Table
    - Summary statistics Table(s)

3) How we decided to use the data
    - Highlight columns or point out key features of the data from the previous tab
    - Possibly include simple visuals to help explain the data
    - Include main question being asked

4) Maching Learning Model - still deciding which to do
    - Regression Model - predicting emissions next year for a country
        - Would it be interesting to do multiple?
    - Unsupervised Learning - Finding clusters in the emission types
        - Is there any geographical pattern that emerges from the clusters? 
    - Neural Network Model? 

5) Answered question - applying the models, what it means for the data/predictions

6) Summary
    - Did the models actually answer the question
    - Was there other data or queries that could have been helpful
    - Any roadblocks or cool things worth sharing


Created an AWS database and bucket to host our files. Afterwards, we pulled our CSVs into a jupyter notebook and cleaned them with pyspark and pandas. Then we submitted them to our PostgreSQL server for database management in the future.
