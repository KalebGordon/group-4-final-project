# Group 4 Final Project

## Selected Topic and Reasoning

For this project, we opted to look at enviornmental data and see if the amount of emissions made by each country had any predictable trends and could be fit into a machine learning model. A dataset containing twenty years of emissions data was selected, [Total Emissions per Country (2000-2020)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/justin2028/total-emissions-per-country-2000-2020 "Kaggle Dataset"), in order to lead to a better predictive performance and to better fit our machine learning model. 

Furthermore, we want to see if we are able to make predictions using this dataset and the machine learning model, and see if environmental protection agreements have had any impact on the environment and amount of emissions produced each year.
