#### Outline for Presentation/Visualizations:
1) Intro Page - overview of the presentation

2) Snapshot of the tables being used.
    - Total Emissions Table
    - Outdoor Air Pollution Table
    - Summary statistics Table(s)

3) How we decided to use the data
    - Highlight columns or point out key features of the data from the previous tab
    - Possibly include simple visuals to help explain the data
    - Include main question being asked

4) Regression Model - predicting emissions next year for a country
    - Would it be interesting to do multiple?

5) Unsupervised Learning - clusters
    - Finding clusters in the emission types
    - Is there any geographical pattern that emerges from the clusters? 
        - Size-focused visual?

6) Neural Network Model? 

7) Answered question - applying the models, what it means for the data/predictions

8) Summary
    - Did the models actually answer the question
    - Was there other data or queries that could have been helpful
    - Any roadblocks or cool things worth sharing
